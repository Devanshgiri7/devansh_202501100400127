    <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1> <hr>
    <h4><b><em>ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WROLD.</em></b></h4>
        <p><b>The Eternal Symbol of Love Rising gracefully on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, the Taj Mahal is India’s most celebrated monument and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a tribute to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this breathtaking masterpiece took over 20 years and thousands of artisans to complete. Crafted from pristine white marble and adorned with intricate gemstone inlay work, the Taj changes its hues with the shifting light of the day—soft pink at dawn, dazzling white in the afternoon, and golden under the moonlight. Blending Persian, Indian, and Islamic architectural styles, its flawless symmetry, majestic dome, and surrounding gardens make it one of the Seven Wonders of the World. More than just a monument, the Taj Mahal is a timeless story of love and devotion that continues to inspire travelers from across the globe.</b></p>
